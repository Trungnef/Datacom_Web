# Project Setup Guide

Hello everyone,

After cloning the project from GitHub, please follow these steps to set up the development environment.

## 1. Install Node.js

Make sure that **Node.js** is installed on your machine. If not, please follow the steps below:

- Go to the official Node.js website: [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Download and install the **LTS** (Long Term Support) version of Node.js.
- Verify that Node.js has been installed successfully by opening a terminal (or cmd) and running the following command:

    ```bash
    node -v
    ```

    This command will display the Node.js version if the installation was successful.

## 2. Install Project Dependencies with npm

Once Node.js is installed, you need to install all project dependencies using npm.

1. Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory where you cloned the project.

    ```bash
    cd cpg-react-app
    ```

2. Install all the dependencies by running:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    This command will install all the necessary packages listed in the `package.json` file.

## 3. Run the Project

After the dependencies are installed, you can run the ReactJS app by using:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
